//Sorting - Sorting is an arrangement of data in a particular order on the bases of some parameters
//parameters - means operation type like numeric order (Asc,desc), mathmatical constant like factors, root..etc
Example -
1. [2,3,9,12,17,19] - array is sorted based on magnitude(value)
2. [1,13,9,6,12]  - array is sorted based on factors (1 factor is 1(#1), 13 factors are 1,3(#2),
                    9 factors are 1,3,3(#3), 6 factors are 1,2,3,6(#4), 12 factors are 1,2,3,4,6,12(#6))
                    so this array is sorted like no of factors of number (1,2,3,4,6)
