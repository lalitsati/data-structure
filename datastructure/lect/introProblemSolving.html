    <b>Basic Maths properties</b> <br>
    <p>
        [a,b] - it means a and b both are inclusive (means at this time we will include value of a and b) <br>
        for example - [2,10] - {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}   - the count of [2,10] is = 9 - it means a<=b <br>
        <b>Formula -  <span style="color: red;background: yellow;">b-a+1</span></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a,b) - it means a and b both are exclusive (means at this time w will not include value of a and b) <br>
        for example - (2,10) - {3,4,5,6,7,8,9}  - the count of (2,10) is = 7 <br>
        <b>Formula - <span style="color: red;background: yellow;">b-a-1</span></b>
    </p>

        <b>Find sum of Nth Number - </b> 1,2,3,,4.......100 (find the sum of all the numbers)
        <span>
            s1 = 1,2,3,4,5.......100 <br>
            s2 = 100,99,98,97,96.......1<br>
            According to the <b>"Gause Principle"</b> - (s1+s2), (s1+s2), (s1+s2) all will be return same Number<<br>
            Example - (100+1=101), (99+2=101), (98+3=101), (97+4=101), (96+5=101), (95+6=101)<br>
            we can write it - 2s = 101*100  where (101-sum of each set, 100-total number of set)<br>
            2s = 101*100 <br>
            s = (101*100)/2;<br>
